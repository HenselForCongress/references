# Terms & Conditions
At Hensel for Congress, we champion open communities, collaboration, and impactful change. Our Terms and Conditions are designed with transparency and support at their core, articulated in plain language to ensure clarity and understanding.


## Acceptance

By engaging with our site, you acknowledge and consent to these terms, forming the basis of our interaction. We're committed to adaptability and transparency; any modifications to these terms will be promptly communicated through our GitHub repository.

 ## Participation

 - **Engagement**: This platform is your gateway to volunteer, receive newsletters, or immerse in the data that drives our mission. Although donations are managed via Anedot, each action you take enriches our collective endeavor.
 - **Content Creation**: Your insights and contributions are invaluable to us. When you share your voice and content, you're enriching our collective mission. Submissions go through a review process to ensure they resonate with our goals. Unless specified otherwise, all contributed content is made available under the AGPL-3.0 license, fostering an open exchange of ideas. Learn more about your rights and responsibilities under this license by visiting [our GitHub license page](https://github.com/HenselForCongress/references/blob/main/LICENSE).

 ## Intellectual Property

Our generated content, whether articles, visuals, or data, is intended for community benefit. You're encouraged to use and attribute this content, helping to amplify our message. While we strive for openness, please be aware that technical constraints might affect direct content linking.

 ## Community Conduct

As Taylor Swift so eloquently conveys in ["You Need to Calm Down,"](https://song.link/https://open.spotify.com/track/6RRNNciQGZEXnqk8SQ9yv5?si=0e6febcda386459e), we advocate for respectful and positive interactions. Any form of harassment or negativity misaligns with our ethos. Our platform is a beacon for constructive dialogue and uplifting engagement.

 ## Dispute Resolution

 Should disagreements arise, our preference is for dialogue and mediation, reflecting the narrative of ["Peace."](https://song.link/https://open.spotify.com/track/7MbT4I8qGntX4fMdqMQgke?si=e2db4b57c76243bb) Should these issues escalate, they will be addressed under the jurisdiction of Arlington, VA.

 ## Updates and Communication

As our campaign evolves, so, too, may these Terms. We pledge to keep you informed of any changes, maintaining our commitment to transparency.

 ## Account Suspension

In instances where conduct significantly diverges from our community standards, temporary suspension may ensue. In such cases, we remember, ["This is me trying."](https://song.link/https://open.spotify.com/track/7kt9e9LFSpN1zQtYEl19o1?si=3f0b5eeb62114d36) and encourage open dialogue for possible reinstatement and positive contributions.

 ## Limitations and Legalities

While our platform and its content aim to inspire and foster change, the digital landscape's inherent unpredictability means we cannot guarantee perfection. Engage with our resources with the understanding that our intentions are grounded in creating a positive impact, even as we navigate potential challenges.
