# Commitment to Security

As a DevOps and Data Engineer by profession and by passion, I integrate my expertise and enthusiasm for robust cybersecurity and data integrity into the heart of Hensel for Congress. Our security infrastructure is not just built; it's crafted, mirroring my personal disdain for unauthorized data usage and sharing. Here's how we ensure your data remains secure and respected:

**End-to-End Encryption:** We secure every piece of data transmitted to and from our servers with Full (strict) SSL/TLS encryption. This setup creates a secure channel, safeguarding your information against unauthorized snooping or interception.

**Utilizing Cloudflare's Suite:** We rely on Cloudflare's comprehensive suite of security services, including the Web Application Firewall (WAF) and advanced DDoS protection. These measures are part of our subscription with Cloudflare, providing an extensive shield against a myriad of online threats.

**Open-Source Security Ecosystem:**
- **Wazuh:** Spearheads our EDR operations, offering in-depth visibility into our systems for security and compliance. It's the backbone for real-time intrusion detection, sophisticated log data analysis, and preemptive threat response.
- **Security Onion Integration:** Our commitment to an ironclad network is bolstered by incorporating Security Onion into our security stack. This integration enhances our network security monitoring and log management, pooling the strengths of tools like Elastic Stack, Suricata, and Zeek for unrivaled network insight.
- **Proactive Threat Intelligence:** By employing threat lists and integrating safety nets like GitHub's MISP warning lists, we remain steps ahead of potential security pitfalls, distinguishing real threats from false positives with precision.

**A Foundation of Zero Trust:** Our security model doesn’t just rely on external tools; it’s built on a zero-trust approach, underpinned by Terraform for system consistency and scalability. Enhanced with YubiKey-powered multi-factor authentication, we verify every access request meticulously, regardless of source.

**Continuous Security Evolution:**
- Our landscape is dynamic, reflecting an ongoing cycle of improvement—from running automated security drills that mimic real-world challenges to staying ahead with regular software updates and employing GitHub Dependabot for our custom apps.
- As we pioneer forward, rolling out Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) for all employed tools shines a light on our supply chain security, ensuring clarity and integrity in the tools we trust.

Security for us is more than a protocol; it's a manifestation of our values—your privacy is paramount, and selling your data without consent is off the table. As both a technologist and a candidate, I personally dive into the intricacies of our security measures because I believe in leading a campaign that not only talks the talk but walks the walk in every sense, especially when it comes to safeguarding our supporters' trust and data.

Your confidence and support empower us to maintain the highest security standards, ensuring that your engagement with Hensel for Congress is both impactful and secure. As we continue to innovate and enhance our security practices, our door remains open for your insights and inquiries.
